* Hashdragon Electron Cash Plugin

  A Electron Cash plugin to manage hashdragons.  This plugin is in *beta*, use at your own risks!

  While in beta, the plugin does not automatically submit any transaction to the network: you need to check
  the transaction in the dialog, and explicitly click "Broadcast" to submit it.  This is to make sure that
  you have the chance to make sure the tx is OK.  As a result, the list of hashdragons will not refresh after
  broadcasting the tx, you need to restart Electron Cash to see updates.
